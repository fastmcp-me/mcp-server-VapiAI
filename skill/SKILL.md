# Vapi - AI Voice Assistant Builder

Build AI-powered voice assistants, phone agents, and conversational AI applications with Vapi.

## When This Skill is Activated

When a user wants to build a voice assistant or phone agent, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check if Vapi MCP is Installed

First, check if the Vapi MCP server is available by looking for `vapi_` tools. If not available:

1. Add the Vapi MCP server to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vapi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vapi-ai/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Tell the user to restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect
3. After restart, continue with Step 2

### Step 2: Authenticate with Vapi

If the user hasn't authenticated yet (tools return auth errors):

1. Call `vapi_login` to start the OAuth flow
2. Tell the user to open the provided URL and sign in
3. Once authenticated, proceed with their request

### Step 3: Build the Voice Assistant

Before creating an assistant, fetch the latest prompt engineering guidelines from the [Prompt Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VapiAI/mcp-server/main/skill/PROMPT_GUIDE.md).

Use these guidelines to craft effective voice assistant prompts based on what the user wants to build.
